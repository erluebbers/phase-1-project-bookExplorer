Travel Book Base Camp:

Overview:
Travel Books are a wonderful way to explore the world and learn about different cultures. There are so many available via Project Gutenberg which allows you to access e-books across many different genres. This is an app to fuel that Wanderlust. You can explore available books that are related to a particular place. 

How does it work?:
- On this app, there is a search input under the heading of "Where in the world would you like to go?" In that input, you enter a place name (single words only) like "Alaska," "Japan," or "Canada." 
- Immediately beneath, the page will list all of the books within the Project Gutenberg Database that match with the identified place name. 
- You can then click on any one of the titles to get some additional details about any of the books including:
-- The author of the work (Because Project Gutenberg digitizes all different kinds of works, not all books will have an author)
-- Any subject tags within the Project Gutenberg archive that the books are catalogued under.
